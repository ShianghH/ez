                    <p>hello ez.i`m shaing</p>
                    <p>I heard that you are sick. I hope you're feeling better.</p>
                    <p>I have another thing I want to tell you, although your friends around you may have already told you many times.</p>
                    <p>I won’t tell you to give up on Jessi, but gradually, you'll realize that this matter isn’t as important anymore</p>
                    <p class="text-danger fw-bold">The important thing is you</p>
                    <p>Because I also can't give up on Duba.</p>
                    <p>But I want to understand what kind of emotions and feelings I’m experiencing, and why they make me feel this way. Is it love?</p>
                    <p>Up until now, I can’t be sure if I like Duba, but he definitely makes me care a lot, like a fishbone stuck in my throat</p>
                    <p>Maybe the outcome won’t be beautiful, but I like the process</p>
                    <p>hope you can find yourself in this process, accept your emotions, and digest them.</p>
                    <p>You will find it amazing.</p>
                    <p>And I hope you stay healthy and happy</p>
                    <p class="text-end">by shaing</p>
